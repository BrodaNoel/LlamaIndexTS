# Create LlamaIndex App

The easiest way to get started with [LlamaIndex](https://www.llamaindex.ai/) is by using `create-llama`. This CLI tool enables you to quickly start building a new LlamaIndex application, with everything set up for you.

## Features

- NextJS, ExpressJS, or FastAPI (python) stateless backend generation ðŸ’»
- Streaming or non-streaming backend âš¡
- Optional `shadcn` frontend generation ðŸŽ¨

## Get Started

You can run `create-llama` in interactive or non-interactive mode.

### Interactive

You can create a new project interactively by running:

```bash
npx create-llama@latest
# or
npm create llama@latest
# or
yarn create llama
# or
pnpm create llama@latest
```

You will be asked for the name of your project, along with other configuration options.

Here is an example:

```bash
>> npm create llama@latest

- [Python docs](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/)
## Running the Application

After creating your new LlamaIndex application, you need to install all the necessary dependencies and build the application before you can start it. Follow these steps:

1. Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Create a production build of the application:

```bash
npm run build
```

3. Start the application:

```bash
npm run start
```

Please note that `npm run start` is meant to start a production server and requires a build to be created first.
